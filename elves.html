                                    at Michal. Later, I was very pleased because Lee asked me to help him clean up the garden he had set up for the employees. But after that, before lunch, Marcus told me I wouldn’t get a raise and went out to some meeting,
                                    he was supposed to come back later. Taking advantage of his absence, I went out of the office fast because I was sad, and I even forgot to eat my oatmeal. I was at home watching rolling derby till evening. [Police report

                                    he even didn’t drink his coffee. He said he has a meeting out of office and will be back at office at 05.00 PM and left. I was pissed because somebody spilled oatmeal in whole fridge, and I had to clean it. After lunch,
                                    Lara asked me to help transport the monitor to her house, so I helped her with the box. Taking advantage of the opportunity, I broke off to sports competitions in other city and I spend there all afternoon and evening,
                                    but I went alone. [Police report states that the alibi is not confirmed]

                                    in the office. Lee was defending Marcus saying that he is very busy with this financial control at next Monday. And Ace’s oatmeal spilled in the fridge, and I had to throw it out. After lunch, I decided that since I
                                    came earlier, I could also leave earlier. Michał, who was very gloomy, asked if he could help me transport the monitor, because he saw that I was struggling with the box. It was not typical for him. I went home and
                                    played piano till evening, like always. [Police report states that neighbors heard music all evening, like every day – but lately is much more harmonic]

                                    me all office gossip and asked if I would take her home after lunch. I refused, because as a good employee I never leave ahead of time, and also there is monitoring in office. I wanted to support Ace somehow, they didn’t
                                    get a raise again, so I asked them to help trim the baccata hedge in the work garden I had set up. Because working together is the best remedy for sadness. We finished before lunch and came back to office. During lunch,
                                    I noticed that someone had finally cleaned the refrigerator - he had even washed the back wall. No one was in the office anymore when I left at 03:00 PM and I went to the theater for a performance. [Police report states
