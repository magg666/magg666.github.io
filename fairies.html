                                    at Emelie. Later, I was very pleased because Luke asked me to help him clean up the garden he had set up for the employees. But after that, before lunch, Marcus told me I wouldn’t get a raise and went out to some meeting,
                                    he was supposed to come back later. Taking advantage of his absence, I went out of the office fast because I was sad, and I even forgot to eat my oatmeal. I was at home watching television till evening. [Police report

                                    hurry, he even didn’t drink his coffee. He said he has a meeting out of office and will be back at office at 05.00 PM and left. I was pissed because somebody spilled oatmeal in whole fridge, and I had to clean it. After
                                    lunch, Maciej asked me to help transport the monitor to his house, so I helped him with the box. Taking advantage of the opportunity, I broke off to sports competitions in other city and I spend there all afternoon
                                    and evening, but I went alone. [Police report states that the alibi is not confirmed]

                                    in the office. Luke was defending Marcus saying that he is very busy with this financial control at next Monday. And Collin’s oatmeal spilled in the fridge, and I had to throw it out. After lunch, I decided that since
                                    I came earlier, I could also leave earlier. Emelie, who was very gloomy, asked if she could help me transport the monitor, because she saw that I was struggling with the box. It was not typical for her. I went home
                                    and played piano till evening, like always. [Police report states that neighbors heard music all evening, like every day – but lately is much more harmonic]

                                    me all office gossip and asked if I would take him home after lunch. I refused, because as a good employee I never leave ahead of time, and also there is monitoring in office. I wanted to support Collin somehow, he
                                    didn’t get a raise again, so I asked him to help trim the baccata hedge in the work garden I had set up. Because working together is the best remedy for sadness. We finished before lunch and came back to office. During
                                    lunch, I noticed that someone had finally cleaned the refrigerator - he had even washed the back wall. No one was in the office anymore when I left at 03:00 PM and I went to the theater for a performance. [Police report
